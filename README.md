## Brainstorm for upcoming TamTamFam app

Get auth, i8ln, and theming to work, play around with Tailwind and Styled components, and take it from there.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To see

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn` to install all dependencies, then

`yarn start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

And then try:

localhost:3000/landing

localhost:/dashboard
